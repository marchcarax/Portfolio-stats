# Portfolio Strategy Analysis

## About the Project
**Portfolio Strategy Analysis** is a Streamlit application developed by Marc, designed to demonstrate the potential of simple investment strategies in outperforming the market over the long term. This project emphasizes the naive principle of maintaining an equal-weighted portfolio, ensuring that each addition to the portfolio is distributed equally among all positions.

## Key Features
- **Equal-Weighted Portfolio Simulation:** Analyze how an equal-weighted investment strategy performs over time.
- **Custom Portfolio Simulation:** Create and track the performance of custom-made portfolios, allowing users to experiment with different compositions and strategies.
- **Focus on US and European Stocks:** The app primarily deals with a mix of US and European stocks, reflecting the developer's personal investment focus.
- **Dynamic Portfolio:** The model portfolio comprises fewer than 20 companies and is updated periodically, every 3 to 6 months, to adapt to changing market conditions.

## How to Use
1. **Select a Strategy:** Choose between an equal-weighted strategy or create your custom portfolio.
2. **Input Portfolio Details:** For custom portfolios, input the specifics of your stock selection, focusing on US and European markets.
3. **Simulate Performance:** The app will simulate and display the performance of your chosen portfolio strategy over the selected timeframe.
4. **Compare and Analyze:** Evaluate the performance against market benchmarks to understand the efficacy of your strategy.

## How to Run
To run the Portfolio Strategy Analysis application on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. **Create a Virtual Environment:** Run `python -m venv .venv` in your terminal to create a new virtual environment.
2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:** 
   - For Windows, run `.venv\Scripts\activate`.
   - For macOS/Linux, run `source .venv/bin/activate`.
3. **Install Requirements:** Install the necessary requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. **Launch the Application:** Start the Streamlit app by executing `streamlit run streamlit-app.py`.
