Easy and quick Portfolio Analysis tools

Main tools I use for Portfolio analysis and optimization.
Remember to keep a history of your portfolio performance by saving the output.txt and pdf in other folders.

For a quick glance at a ticker fundamental data, run fanal_main.py and put the Stock Ticker to analyze.


Will update in the future with strategies of how to use these tools and how to add/take exposure from the market.
Also, will upload some personal projects with time:
    1. FC tools: predictive models are mostly useless in Fat tails distributions, but there are some interesting uses.
    2. Some of my most successful trading strategies (Mean reversion, Pairs trading)
