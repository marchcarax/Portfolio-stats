Easy and quick Portfolio Analysis tools

Main tools I use for Portfolio analysis and optimization.
Remember to keep a history of your portfolio performance by saving the output.txt and pdf in other folders.

For a quick glance at a ticker fundamental data, run fanal_main.py and put the Stock Ticker to analyze.

How to use:
* Open Stats_main.py and put the stocks names from your portfolio (same name from yahoo finance i.e. Repsol is rep.mc) and weights
* Define the period you want to analyze
* Run to_pdf.py file
* Open output.txt and pdf file 

Will update in the future with strategies of how to use these tools and how to add/take exposure from the market.
Also, will upload some personal projects with time:
* Predictive modelling: we will research the utility of basic predictive models
* Some of my most successful trading strategies (Mean reversion, Pairs trading)
